|		       ~ HOW TO FILL THE CONFIG FILE ~			        |
|									        |
|           Your declarations have to be between <DEF> and </DEF>	        |
|              A point of view and only one has to be set		        |
|									        |
| The different settings are:						        |
| FORM: You can choose: SPHERE / PLAN / VIEW / CYLINDRE / CONE / LIGHT / ID_OBJ |
|                       PARABOLOID / HYPERBOLOID / ELLIPSOID / TORE / DINGDONG  |
|			CUBE / STAR / MOBIUS					|
| POS: X = / Y= / Z = / Position in the space. 		      		        |
| ROTATE: X = / Y = / Z = / Rotation in the space.			        |
| H_LIM: X = / Y = / Z = / Limit on the top of the object.		        |
| B_LIM: X = / Y = / Z = / Limit on the bot of the object.		        |
| RAYON: The rayon of the object.   	    				        |
| ANGLE: The angle of the cone (in degrees).				        |
| BRILLANCE: The brillance of the object (in percent).			        |
| TRANSPARENCE: The transparence of the object (in percent).		        |
| REFLEXION: The reflexion of the object (in percent).			        |
| COLOR: A value in hexadecimal.  	     				        |
| SPECULARITE: Percentage of Phong effect on an object.				|
| REMPLISSAGE: Percentage of the size of the cube's hole.			|
| SHEET: Number of sheet of hyperboloid.					|
| DAMIER: Put value in hexadecimal if you want to show damier.		        |
| FOCUS: 0 -> There is no focus on the object. 	       			        |
| LUMOS: 1 -> Change a plan to a lumos plan.					|
| SIZE: 100% is the default size of the obj. It can be increased or decreased.  |
| DISTORSION: Dist_1 / Dist_2 / Dist_3 / -OID obj and MÃ¶bius  -100 <= X <= 100  |
| XPM: ID_XPM_DEFINED. Only for the sphere.					|
| VIDEO: ID_VIDEO_DEFINED. Apply a movement defined in .vid file.		|
| CIRCONFERENCE: The rayon of the tore's hole.					|

|                         ~ HOW TO DECLARE DEFINES ~			        |
|									        |
|      You can declare defines where you want except in the <DEF></DEF>	        |
|   DECLARATION : #define     SETTING	      VALUE  	    [PATH]	        |
|   		  	      		      		    		        |
| You can parameter with defines:					        |
| Antialiasing->  #define      a_a          1 / 2 / 4	     NULL	        |
|    Width    ->  #define     width            > 0           NULL 	        |
|    Height   ->  #define     height           > 0           NULL               |
|    Object   ->  #define      obj      > 0 (UNIQUE ID)   path ("scene/.obj")   |
|     XPM     ->  #define      xpm      > 0 (UNIQUE ID)   path ("texture/.xpm") |
|    Video    ->  #define     video     > 0 (UNIQUE ID)   path ("scene/.vid")   |

|			~ HOW TO FILL THE VIDEO FILE ~				|
|										|
|           Your declarations have to be between <VID> and </VID>	        |
|          A translation and a rotation has to be set in each one.	        |
|										|
| The different settings are:							|
| POS: X = / Y = / Z = / Final position of the object (translation).		|
| ROTATE: X = / Y = / Z = / Final position of the object (rotation).		|
| ROT_CENT:    X = Y = Z =               /                    X = Y = Z =	|
|	          ^^^                    ^                       ^^^		|
|        Position central point     (Separater)           Angle of rotation	|
